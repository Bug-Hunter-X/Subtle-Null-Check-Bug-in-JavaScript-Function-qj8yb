# Subtle Null Check Bug in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in JavaScript related to null checks within a function. The `foo` function is designed to add two numbers, but its handling of null values is flawed. The goal is to improve the function to handle cases where one argument might be null or undefined while still performing the addition whenever possible.
